# intelligent DaaS Partner Implementations
iDaaS is enabling organizations to make data a product and build assets on top of it. 
Because <b>"Data is the asset!!!"</b> iDaaS is about enabling information for knowledge 
that can be used for action in a secure and scalable manner. Along with helping 
organizations it is also being used and adopted by numerous system integrators.
Since doing our first release in May of 2020 we have seen so appreciated those 
customers and systems integrators that have implemented their solution or solution offerings 
powered with iDaaS.
